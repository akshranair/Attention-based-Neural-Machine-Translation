# Attention-based-Neural-Machine-Translation

In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to accurately translate text from one language to another is of utmost importance. This project aims to develop an attention-based neural machine translation model specifically designed for translating German text to English. By utilizing the widely-used WMT https://huggingface.co/datasets/wmt16/viewer/de-en dataset, which provides a rich collection of parallel German-English sentence pairs, we can train and evaluate the model to achieve accurate and contextually-aware translations.
